      <title>Why are serial interfaces everywhere - instead of parallel ones</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;USB, SPI, IÂ²C, Sata - all these interfaces is common that they are serial interfaces. Serial interfaces are todays common.&#xA;But why is that the case, especially for high-speed communication? it sounds simply counterintuitive: Parallel wires&#xA;can theoretically send more bits per time than on singular wire can.&#xA;The answer to that question is complex and multilayered. There are multiple different reasons why&#xA;serial interfaces are preferred over parallel interfaces. Lets start with the obvious ones:&#xA;The PCB routing of busses of  8, 16, 32 or even 64 bit width gets increasingly complex to route on printed circuits&#xA;boards (PCBs).The second problem, related to this, is that signal slope need to get transmitted at the same time&#xA;for all parallel lines (wires), which results in a more complex routing since edges in the strip conductor needs to be compensated.&#xA;Simply put the additional logic implemented in chips to convert the serial signal to parallel ones again (deserializer) and vice versa&#xA;(serializer) is much cheaper than the costs of complex routings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
